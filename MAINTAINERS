= Generalist Code Reviewers =

Oslo has a cadre of core reviewers who have taken on a generalist role
on the project. They are folks with good taste in Python code, provide
constructive input in their reviews and make time to review any patches
submitted to the project, irrespective of the area which a given patch
targets.

The current members of oslo-core are listed here:

  https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/106,members

This the group who can +2 and approve patches in oslo. However, they may
choose to seek feedback from the appropriate specialist API maintainer
before approving a patch if it is in any way controversial or risky.

= Specialist API Maintainers =

APIs in oslo-incubator are resting here temporarily until they have been
cleaned up sufficiently so that we can make a commitment to backwards
compatibility and release the API in a properly published library.

While in oslo-incubator, an API should have one or more specialist
maintainers who have taken on the following responsibilities:

  - Developing a roadmap for the API graduating from the incubator

  - Reviewing changes proposed for that API - a +1 from an API
    maintainer should be treated as a +2 by oslo-core members

  - Keeping track of which Integrated projects are using the API and
    helping to ensure the API meets the use cases of those projects

  - Ensuring that any incompatible or potentially troublesome changes
    are synced from oslo-incubator into the projects using the API,
    either by performing the sync themselves are asking that the authors
    of the patch perform the sync

= List of API Maintainers =

Each API has an entry with the following keys:

 M: Maintainer email address
 S: Status, one of the following:
      Maintained:  Has an active maintainer
      Orphan:      No current maintainer, feel free to step up!
      Graduating:  Currently being moved out of the incubator to a standalone project.
      Obsolete:    Replaced by newer code, or a dead end, or out-dated
