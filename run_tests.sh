# Current scriipt is the simple wrapper on common tools/run_tests_common.sh
# scrip. It pass project specific variables to common script.
#
# Optins list (from tools/run_tests_common.sh).
# Use `./run_tests.sh -h` `./run_tests.sh --help` to get usage message
#
#  -V, --virtual-env          Always use virtualenv. Install automatically if not present
#  -N, --no-virtual-env       Don't use virtualenv. Run tests in local environment
#  -s, --no-site-packages     Isolate the virtualenv from the global Python environment
#  -r, --recreate-db          Recreate the test database (deprecated, as this is now the default).
#  -n, --no-recreate-db       Don't recreate the test database.
#  -f, --force                Force a clean re-build of the virtual environment. Useful when dependencies have been added.
#  -u, --update               Update the virtual environment with any newer package versions
#  -p, --pep8                 Just run PEP8 and HACKING compliance check
#  -P, --no-pep8              Don't run static code checks
#  -c, --coverage             Generate coverage report
#  -d, --debug                Run tests with testtools instead of testr. This allows you to use the debugger.
#  -h, --help                 Print this usage message
#  --hide-elapsed             Don't print the elapsed time for each test along with slow test list
#  --virtual-env-path <path>  Location of the virtualenv directory. Default: \$(pwd)
#  --virtual-env-name <name>  Name of the virtualenv directory. Default: .venv
#  --tools-path <dir>         Location of the tools directory. Default: \$(pwd)
# 
#  Note: with no options specified, the script will try to run the tests in a virtual environment,
#        If no virtualenv is found, the script will ask if you would like to create one.  If you 
#        prefer to run tests NOT in a virtual environment, simply pass the -N option.


# On Linux, testrepository will inspect /proc/cpuinfo to determine how many
# CPUs are present in the machine, and run one worker per CPU.
