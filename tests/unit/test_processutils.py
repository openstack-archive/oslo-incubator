        till before him the folk, both far and near,
        who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate,
        gabe him gits: a good king he!

        a son in his halls, whom heaven sent
        to favor the fol, feeling their woe
        that erst they had lacked an earl for leader
        so long a while; the Lord endowed him,
        the Wielder of Wonder, with world's renown.
