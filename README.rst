The Oslo Incubator
------------------

The Oslo program produces a set of python libraries containing
infrastructure code shared by OpenStack projects. The APIs provided by
these libraries should be high quality, stable, consistent and
generally useful.

The process of developing a new Oslo API usually begins by taking code
which is common to some OpenStack projects and moving it into this
repository. Incubation shouldn't be seen as a long term option for any
API - it is merely a stepping stone to inclusion into a published Oslo
library.
