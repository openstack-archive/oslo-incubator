"""
Code for rpc message dispatching.

Messages that come in have a version number associated with them.  RPC API
version numbers are in the form:

    Major.Minor

For a given message with version X.Y, the receiver must be marked as able to
handle messages of version A.B, where:

    A = X

    B >= Y

The Major version number would be incremented for an almost completely new API.
The Minor version number would be incremented for backwards compatible changes
to an existing API.  A backwards compatible change could be something like
adding a new method, adding an argument to an existing method (but not
requiring it), or changing the type for an existing argument (but still
handling the old type as well).

The conversion over to a versioned API must be done on both the client side and
server side of the API at the same time.  However, as the code stands today,
there can be both versioned and unversioned APIs implemented in the same code
base.

EXAMPLES
========

Nova was the first project to use versioned rpc APIs.  Consider the compute rpc
API as an example.  The client side is in nova/compute/rpcapi.py and the server
side is in nova/compute/manager.py.


Example 1) Adding a new method.
-------------------------------

Adding a new method is a backwards compatible change.  It should be added to
nova/compute/manager.py, and RPC_API_VERSION should be bumped from X.Y to
X.Y+1.  On the client side, the new method in nova/compute/rpcapi.py should
have a specific version specified to indicate the minimum API version that must
be implemented for the method to be supported.  For example::

    def get_host_uptime(self, ctxt, host):
        topic = _compute_topic(self.topic, ctxt, host, None)
        return self.call(ctxt, self.make_msg('get_host_uptime'), topic,
                version='1.1')

In this case, version '1.1' is the first version that supported the
get_host_uptime() method.


Example 2) Adding a new parameter.
----------------------------------

Adding a new parameter to an rpc method can be made backwards compatible.  The
RPC_API_VERSION on the server side (nova/compute/manager.py) should be bumped.
The implementation of the method must not expect the parameter to be present.::

    def some_remote_method(self, arg1, arg2, newarg=None):
        # The code needs to deal with newarg=None for cases
        # where an older client sends a message without it.
        pass

On the client side, the same changes should be made as in example 1.  The
minimum version that supports the new parameter should be specified.
