"""
Code for rpc message dispatching.

Messages that come in have a version number associated with them.  RPC API
version numbers are in the form:

    Major.Minor

For a given message with version X.Y, the receiver must be marked as able to
handle messages of version A.B, where:

    A = X

    B >= Y

The Major version number would be incremented for an almost completely new API.
The Minor version number would be incremented for backwards compatible changes
to an existing API.  A backwards compatible change could be something like
adding a new method, adding an argument to an existing method (but not
requiring it), or changing the type for an existing argument (but still
handling the old type as well).

The conversion over to a versioned API must be done on both the client side and
server side of the API at the same time.  However, as the code stands today,
there can be both versioned and unversioned APIs implemented in the same code
base.
