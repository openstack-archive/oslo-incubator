    issues like bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=632857 and does
    not require any cleanup. Since the lock is always held on a file
    descriptor rather than outside of the process, the lock gets dropped
    automatically if the process crashes, even if __exit__ is not executed.

    There are no guarantees regarding usage by multiple green threads in a
    single process here. This lock works only between processes. Exclusive
    access between local threads should be achieved using the semaphores
    in the @synchronized decorator.

    Note these locks are released when the descriptor is closed, so it's not
    safe to close the file descriptor while another green thread holds the
    lock. Just opening and closing the lock file can break synchronisation,
    so lock files must be accessed only using this abstraction.
