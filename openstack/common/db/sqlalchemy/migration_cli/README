Thic module could be used either for:
1. Smooth transition from migrate tool to alembic
2. As standalone alembic tool
It also can be used for 'migrate' migrations, but no sense in that

This options is used by app internally:

_db_opts = [
    cfg.StrOpt('alembic_ini_path',
               default='',
               help=('Full path to alembic.ini file.')),
    cfg.StrOpt('migrate_repo_path',
               default='',
               help=('Full path to migrate_repo')),
]

If you don't want to use migrate plugin with some project just
dont touch 'migrate_repo_path' variable.

Core points:
1. Upgrade/downgrade database with usage of alembic/migrate migrations
or both
2. Compatability with oslo.config
3. The way to autogenerate new revisions or stamps
