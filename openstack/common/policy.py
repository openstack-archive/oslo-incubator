    """Enforces authorization of some rules against credentials.

    :param match_list: nested tuples of data to match against

        The basic brain supports three types of match lists:

            1) rules

                looks like: ``('rule:compute:get_instance',)``

                Retrieves the named rule from the rules dict and recursively
                checks against the contents of the rule.

            2) roles

                looks like: ``('role:compute:admin',)``

                Matches if the specified role is in credentials_dict['roles'].

            3) generic

                looks like: ``('tenant_id:%(tenant_id)s',)``

                Substitutes values from the target dict into the match using
                the % operator and matches them against the creds dict.

        Combining rules:

            The brain returns True if any of the outer tuple of rules
            match and also True if all of the inner tuples match. You
            can use this to perform simple boolean logic.  For
            example, the following rule would return True if the creds
            contain the role 'admin' OR the if the tenant_id matches
            the target dict AND the the creds contains the role
            'compute_sysadmin':

            ::

                {
                    "rule:combined": (
                        'role:admin',
                        ('tenant_id:%(tenant_id)s', 'role:compute_sysadmin')
                    )
                }

        Note that rule and role are reserved words in the credentials match, so
        you can't match against properties with those names. Custom brains may
        also add new reserved words. For example, the HttpBrain adds http as a
        reserved word.

    :param target_dict: dict of object properties

      Target dicts contain as much information as we can about the object being
      operated on.

    :param credentials_dict: dict of actor properties

      Credentials dicts contain as much information as we can about the user
      performing the action.

    :param exc: exception to raise

      Class of the exception to raise if the check fails.  Any remaining
      arguments passed to enforce() (both positional and keyword arguments)
      will be passed to the exception class.  If exc is not provided, returns
      False.

    :return: True if the policy allows the action
    :return: False if the policy does not allow the action and exc is not set
