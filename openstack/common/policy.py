Common Policy Engine Implementation

Policies can be expressed in one of two forms: A list of lists, or a
string written in the new policy language.

In the list-of-lists representation, each check inside the innermost
list is combined as with an "and" conjunction--for that check to pass,
all the specified checks must pass.  These innermost lists are then
combined as with an "or" conjunction.  This is the original way of
expressing policies, but there now exists a new way: the policy
language.

In the policy language, each check is specified the same way as in the
list-of-lists representation: a simple "a:b" pair that is matched to
the correct code to perform that check.  However, conjunction
operators are available, allowing for more expressiveness in crafting
policies.

As an example, take the following rule, expressed in the list-of-lists
representation::

    [["role:admin"], ["project_id:%(project_id)s", "role:projectadmin"]]

In the policy language, this becomes::

    role:admin or (project_id:%(project_id)s and role:projectadmin)

The policy language also has the "not" operator, allowing a richer
policy rule::

    project_id:%(project_id)s and not role:dunce

The policy language also allows for finer-grained policies.  Consider
a function that not only wants to check whether a user is allowed to
modify an object, but wants to see which set of fields the user is
allowed to modify.  For this, we can use the new "case" expression::

    case {
        "fulladmin" = role:admin;
        "projectadmin" = project_id:%(project_id)s and role:projectadmin
    }

(Note this expression is broken across lines for readability; this
would be specified as a single string to the policy language parser.)

For this rule, each of the checks is performed in turn, i.e., first we
check "role:admin", then we check "project_id:%(project_id)s and
role:projectadmin".  For the first check that succeeds, we return the
string on the left-hand side of the '=', so if "role:admin" matches,
we would get the string "fulladmin" back, instead of just the "True"
value.  If none of the checks succeeds, then the "False" value will be
returned.

Finally, two special policy checks should be mentioned; the policy
check "@" will always accept an access, and the policy check "!" will
always reject an access.  (Note that if a rule is either the empty
list ("[]") or the empty string, this is equivalent to the "@" policy
check.)  Of these, the "!" policy check is probably the most useful,
as it allows particular rules to be explicitly disabled.
